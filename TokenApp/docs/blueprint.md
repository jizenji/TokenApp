## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to reflect trustworthiness and stability. It suits the data-focused nature of the app.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), for a clean, professional feel.
- Accent color: A teal (#008080), used for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons. Its analogous relationship to blue provides visual harmony while differentiating interactive elements.
- Use a clean and readable sans-serif font to ensure the information is easily digestible.
- Implement a clean, card-based UI, to provide a structured presentation of the token and customer data.
- Use consistent and clear icons, primarily for navigation and data representation.
- Subtle transitions for a smooth user experience.
